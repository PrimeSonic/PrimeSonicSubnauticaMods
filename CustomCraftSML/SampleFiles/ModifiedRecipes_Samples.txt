# This is a sample file for modifying crafting recipes for in-game items #
# Remember that this is only intended for use with items that already craftable in the base game #
# This won't work with modded items #
# If the item can't normally be crafted, use the AddedRecipes file instead #

# You can use this file as a starting point. The text here is ready to use. #
