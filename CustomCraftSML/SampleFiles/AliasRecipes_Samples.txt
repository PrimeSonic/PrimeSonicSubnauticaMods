# This is a sample file for adding new crafting recipes for custom items #
# This recipe format is intended for use with items that do not exist in the base game #

# There are two ways to associate a sprite with the new items - first by having #
#     a png file in the Assets folder that matches the ItemID (eg - GallonWater.png) #
# If there is no PNG file found, then the sprite of first LinkedItemID will be used #

# There are two common uses for this recipe #
#   1.  To create a custom item and produce that item. #
#       in this case - you want to add a new sprite asset #
#       set the AmountCrafted >= 1 and fill in the remaining items #
#   2.  The second common use is to create ano item that already has a recipe in-game #
#       (see WaterFromGallon below).  The recipe cannot directly output DisinfectedWater #
#       as there is already a recipe for that (salt + bleach).  However, we can accomplish #
#       this by making up a new ItemID, then making the recipe produce 0 of these #
#       But, we can also have the recipe produce DisinfectedWater via the LinkedItemIDs #

# The format is similar to AddedRecipe - but with a few new fields #
#       DisplayName = the display name (if using the fabricator this is the larger/bold text) #
#       Tooltip     = the descriptive text below the DisplayName in the fabricator menu #

# You can use this file as a starting point. The examples here are ready to use. #
